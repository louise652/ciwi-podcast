# Add audio file to the Wordpress RSS feed
1. Once the audio files are in the repo, they can be added to the website as a post.
Login in to the wordpress admin site and go into the settings. Click Posts on the left hand side and 'Add a new post'

2. Add the Episode title in the format 'Episode XX- Title of Episode'. Then below the title type /audio and select the audio dropdown option.

3. On the right pane, click on Post for the settings. Select the author. Select Podcast as the category (or it will NOT publish to Spotify). Write a brief excerpt describing the podcast episode.

4. Finally, click on insert from url and enter the url of the audio file, located on Github. In the repo, locate the audio file, right click the View Raw link and copy the link address- this will be what you need.

5. Publish and save all the changes and Spotify should pick up the new episode :)
